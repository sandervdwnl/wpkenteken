<p>Navigate to the <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/opendata.rdw.nl/qyrd-w56j" target="_blank">RDW Open Data API page</a> and choose <strong>'API'</strong>. There you can register for an API key. <br>
When you have received the API key, go to WordPress admin and choose <strong>'Settings'</strong> and then <strong>'WPKenteken'</strong>. There you can fill in the API key and your key will be saved in the database.</p>
